# Summary

State-of-the-art programming approaches generally have a strict
division between intra-node shared memory parallelism and inter-node
MPI communication.  Tasking with dependencies offers a clean,
dependable abstraction for a wide range of hardware and situations
within a node, but research on task offloading between nodes is still
relatively immature.

In the paper we present
[OmpSs-2@Clusters](https://github.com/bsc-pm/ompss-2-cluster-releases)
runtime system and programming model.  Which is the distributed memory
evolution of the [OmpSs](https://pm.bsc.es/ftp/ompss-2/doc/spec/) task
based programming model and the
[nanos6](https://github.com/bsc-pm/nanos6) runtime.  This artifact
[@Aguilar2022Artifact] includes how to reproduce the scalability
results in the main paper with the same title.  The whole artifact
includes an **Overview** document with a detailed description of the
actions to perform and some bash script to automatize the basic steps,
process the results and construct the graphs.

# Statement of need

Reproducibility is a fundamental step in scientific development and
research. Modern systems in High Performance Computing are more
complex either in software and hardware making data reproduction
cumbersome and very time consuming.
